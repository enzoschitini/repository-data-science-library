    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Size Limit contains a CLI tool, 3 plugins (`file`, `webpack`, `time`)\n",
    "   and 3 plugin presets for popular use cases (`app`, `big-lib`, `small-lib`).\n",
    "   A CLI tool finds plugins in `package.json` and loads the config.\n",
    "2. If you use the `webpack` plugin, Size Limit will bundle your JS files into\n",
    "   a single file. It is important to track dependencies and webpack polyfills.\n",
    "   It is also useful for small libraries with many small files and without\n",
    "   a bundler.\n",
    "3. The `webpack` plugin creates an empty webpack project, adds your library\n",
    "   and looks for the bundle size difference.\n",
    "4. The `time` plugin compares the current machine performance with that of\n",
    "   a low-priced Android devices to calculate the CPU throttling rate.\n",
    "5. Then the `time` plugin runs headless Chrome (or desktop Chrome if it’s\n",
    "   available) to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.\n",
    "   Note that these measurements depend on available resources and might\n",
    "   be unstable. [See here](https://github.com/mbalabash/estimo/issues/5)\n",
    "   for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Here’s how you can get the size for your current project:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    $ npm run size\n",
    "\n",
    "      Package size: 30.08 kB with all dependencies, minified and brotlied\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now, let’s set the limit. Add 25% to the current total size and use that as\n",
    "   the limit in your `package.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```diff\n",
    "      \"size-limit\": [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "    +     \"limit\": \"35 kB\",\n",
    "          \"path\": \"dist/app-*.js\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "      ],\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add the `size` script to your test suite:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```diff\n",
    "      \"scripts\": {\n",
    "        \"build\": \"webpack ./webpack.config.js\",\n",
    "        \"size\": \"npm run build && size-limit\",\n",
    "    -   \"test\": \"vitest && eslint .\"\n",
    "    +   \"test\": \"vitest && eslint . && npm run size\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If you don’t have a continuous integration service running, don’t forget\n",
    "   to add one — start with Github Actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### JS Application and Time-based Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "File size limit (in kB) is not the best way to describe your JS application\n",
    "cost for developers. Developers will compare the size of the JS bundle\n",
    "with the size of images. But browsers need much more time to parse 100 kB\n",
    "of JS than 100 kB of an image since JS compilers are very complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Size Limit support time-based limit. It runs headless Chrome\n",
    "to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.\n",

    "### Plugins and Presets\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins or plugin presets will be loaded automatically from `package.json`.\n",
    "For example, if you want to use `@size-limit/webpack`, you can just use\n",
    "`npm install --save-dev @size-limit/webpack`, or you can use our preset\n",
    "`@size-limit/preset-big-lib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@size-limit/file` checks the size of files with Brotli (default), Gzip\n",
    "  or without compression.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/webpack` adds your library to empty webpack project\n",
    "  and prepares bundle file for `file` plugin.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/webpack-why` adds reports for `webpack` plugin\n",
    "  about your library is of this size to show the cost of all your\n",
    "  dependencies.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/webpack-css` adds css support for `webpack` plugin.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/esbuild` is like `webpack` plugin, but uses `esbuild`\n",
    "  to be faster and use less space in `node_modules`.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/esbuild-why` add reports for `esbuild` plugin\n",
    "  about your library is of this size to show the cost of all your\n",
    "  dependencies.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/time` uses headless Chrome to track time to execute JS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugin presets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@size-limit/preset-app` contains `file` and `time` plugins.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/preset-big-lib` contains `webpack`, `file`, and `time` plugins.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/preset-small-lib` contains `esbuild` and `file` plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third-Party Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Third-party plugins and presets named starting with `size-limit-` are also supported.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`size-limit-node-esbuild`](https://github.com/un-ts/size-limit/tree/main/packages/node-esbuild)\n",
    "  is like `@size-limit/esbuild` but for Node libraries.\n",
    "* [`size-limit-preset-node-lib`](https://github.com/un-ts/size-limit/tree/main/packages/preset-node-lib)\n",
    "  is like `@size-limit/preset-small-lib` but for Node libraries which contains\n",
    "  above `node-esbuild` and core `file` plugins.\n",
    "* [`nx-size-limit`](https://github.com/LironHazan/nx-size-limit)\n",
    "  is an [NX](https://nx.dev/community) build system community plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limits Config\n",
    "\n",
    "Size Limits supports three ways to define limits config.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `size-limit` section in `package.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "     \"size-limit\": [\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"path\": \"index.js\",\n",
    "         \"import\": \"{ createStore }\",\n",
    "         \"limit\": \"500 ms\"\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. or a separate `.size-limit.json` config file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   [\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"path\": \"index.js\",\n",
    "       \"import\": \"{ createStore }\",\n",
    "       \"limit\": \"500 ms\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. or a more flexible `.size-limit.js` or `.size-limit.cjs` config file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   module.exports = [\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       path: \"index.js\",\n",
    "       import: \"{ createStore }\",\n",
    "       limit: \"500 ms\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section in the config can have these options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **path**: relative paths to files. The only mandatory option.\n",
    "  It could be a path `\"index.js\"`, a [pattern] `\"dist/app-*.js\"`\n",
    "  or an array `[\"index.js\", \"dist/app-*.js\", \"!dist/app-exclude.js\"]`.\n",
    "* **import**: partial import to test tree-shaking. It could be `\"{ lib }\"`\n",
    "  to test `import { lib } from 'lib'`, `*` to test all exports,\n",
    "  or `{ \"a.js\": \"{ a }\", \"b.js\": \"{ b }\" }` to test multiple files.\n",
    "* **limit**: size or time limit for files from the `path` option. It should be\n",
    "  a string with a number and unit, separated by a space.\n",
    "  Format: `100 B`, `10 kB`, `500 ms`, `1 s`.\n",
    "* **name**: the name of the current section. It will only be useful\n",
    "  if you have multiple sections.\n",
    "* **entry**: when using a custom webpack config, a webpack entry could be given.\n",
    "  It could be a string or an array of strings.\n",
    "  By default, the total size of all entry points will be checked.\n",
    "* **webpack**: with `false` it will disable webpack.\n",
    "* **running**: with `false` it will disable calculating running time.\n",
    "* **gzip**: with `true` it will use Gzip compression and disable\n",
    "  Brotli compression.\n",
    "* **brotli**: with `false` it will disable any compression.\n",
    "* **config**: a path to a custom webpack config.\n",
    "* **ignore**: an array of files and dependencies to exclude from\n",
    "  the project size calculation.\n",
    "* **modifyWebpackConfig**: (.size-limit.js only) function that can be used\n",
    "  to do last-minute changes to the webpack config, like adding a plugin.\n",
    "* **compareWith**: path to `stats.json` from another build to compare\n",
    "  (when `--why` is using).\n",
    "* **uiReports**: custom UI reports list (see [Statoscope docs]).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Size Limit to track the size of CSS files, make sure to set\n",
    "`webpack: false`. Otherwise, you will get wrong numbers, because webpack\n",
    "inserts `style-loader` runtime (≈2 kB) into the bundle.\n",
    "\n",

    "[pattern]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby#globbing-patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyze with `--why`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run `size-limit --why` to analyze the bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install `@size-limit/esbuild-why` or `@size-limit/webpack-why`\n",
    "depends on which bundler you are using (default is `esbuild`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For `@size-limit/esbuild-why`,\n",
    "it will generate a `esbuild-why.html` at the current directory & open it in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you also specify `--save-bundle <DIR>`,\n",
    "the report will be generated inside `<DIR>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple sections in your config,\n",
    "the files will be named `esbuild-why-{n}.html`,\n",
    "or you can give it a custom name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsonc\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"cjs\",\n",
    "    /* snap */\n",

    "    /* snap */\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce `esbuild-why-cjs.html` and `esbuild-why-esm.html` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `@size-limit/webpack-why`,\n",
    "it will generate the report and open it in the browser automatically.\n",
